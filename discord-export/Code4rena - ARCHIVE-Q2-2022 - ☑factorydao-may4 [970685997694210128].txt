In `FixedPricePassThruGate.sol` : What is meant by `/// @notice This contract has a management key that can add new gates`? Thanks!

What was the reasoning of choosing a `mapping(uint->MerkleTree)` over a `MerkleTree[]` array in `MerkleDropFactory.sol`?

**🚨 CONTEST ALERT**

@🐺wardens  The** FactoryDAO** contest is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: the FactoryDAO team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. Keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through awarding 🤑🏆, judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜. Feel free to ping a contest administrator if you have questions along the way!

Do we have any expected date of the FactoryDAO report?


[05/10/2022 1:32 PM] itsmetechjay
We have an ideal timeline in our docs, which is the goal we're working towards: https://docs.code4rena.com/structure/our-process.  In reality, things are slower than outlined there, but we are working on some tooling to help improve these times.

Right now, the sponsor is currently reviewing the submissions and then it will get handed off to a judge. Once judging is finished and awards announced, we will start work on the report.


[05/10/2022 1:54 PM] saxenism
Awesome. Thanks for the update.

Can you also tell how many wardens/teams submitted their findings? 😅


[05/10/2022 2:21 PM] cloudellie
It'll be a lot easier to do that once we get judging underway, so give us a few days and we should be able to pull that info up for you quickly. 🙂
